# Objective-c

This is a quick write up on how to start learning objective-c. 

## Language features
Objective-c is a weird looking language. It's an object oriented procedural language that uses dynamic typing and dynamic binding. Here's a list of a few features that may take some getting used to. 
### Methods
Methods can also be referred to as message passing. Methods are invoked in the form of ```[object method:parameter];```. Instead of invoking a method on another object, you are asking it nicely to please do it and let you know what happens. This is similar to a language called Smalltalk (this won't be news to you if you've met Richard O'Keefe). This is were dynamic binding comes into play, the compiler doesn't resolve what methods will be called, instead this is worked out at runtime. In practice this is similar to overriding methods in Java or other languages.
#### Declaration
The following examples are methods that belong to the [NSArray class](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/NSArray.html)
##### A method declaration with no parameters:
```objective-c
- (id)firstObject
```
The hyphen means it is an instance method (non-static for you Java nuts) where a plus would mean static.
The id in brackets is the return type and firstObject is the method name. This would be followed by a semi colon to declare the method or set of curly braces with the method body.
(id means the pointer that all NSObjects must have)
##### A method declaration with one parameter:
```objective-c
- (id)objectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index
```
A colon indicates that a parameter is to follow, of type NSUInteger (an unsigned long) with the parameter name index. Parameters can objects, structs, blocks of code, method signatures (called selectors) or primitive types.
##### A method with more than one parameter:
```objective-c
- (NSUInteger)indexOfObject:(id)anObject inRange:(NSRange)range
- (NSUInteger)indexOfObject:(id)anObject:(NSRange)range //equivalent to above. 'inRange' is optional text which is useful for a readability perspective
```
Instead of the usual comma separated list of parameters, objective-c uses a much longer style. Methods instead use a space, a phrase and then a colon to seperate each parameter. Methods cannot be overloaded, but there is no need to - you can just change part of the name to reflect the difference. This pattern will work well for up to 4 parameters, after which you should consider passing in a dictionary, or switching to other object oriented design patterns.

#### Call
For the following examples, assume a succesfully initialised NSArray object named array. Creative.
##### No parameters
```objective-c
NSString *string = [array firstObject];
```
This example accesses the first object in the array, and assigns it to a new NSString.  Like c the * just means it is a pointer to an object. 
##### One parameter
```objective-c
NSString *string = [array objectAtIndex:1];
```
This accesses the second object in the array, and assigns it to a new NSString named string.
##### Lots of parameters
```objective-c
int index = [array indexOfObject:@"Hello" inRange:NSMakeRange(0, [array count]/2)];
```
This will look for the object in only the first half of the array. From the documentation I know that it is calling the isEqual method on each object, so it's looking at deep equality rather than shallow. For the range parameter I am using a c style method, which returns a range struct. This can all happen as objective-c is built on top of c, any c code is valid objective-c code. As a parameter to the c method I am using the count method of the array to get its length. 

## Variables
###Primitives
Booleans can be bool or BOOL and can be assigned values of YES, NO, true, false. YES and NO and BOOL are effectively just macros that mean yes == true and no == false and BOOL == bool, so using any combinations of these makes no difference whatsoever. 
```objective-c
BOOL b; 
bool b;
b = YES;
b = true;
b = NO;
b = false;
```
Ints are the same as every other language essentially. If you dont know how ints work by now, then it is amazing that you have made it to 3rd year.
```objective-c
int i = 7;
```
Doubles/floats - as above
```objective-c
double d = 3.1;
float f = 4.0;
[someObject someMethodThatTakesAFloatAsAnArgument:1.0f]; //The f suffix is commonly used to make sure a number is a float
```
Chars and unichars
```objective-c
char c = 'v';
unichar c = 'k';
```

### Instance
Instance variables are objects that you need to initialise through a class constructor.
In java this is done as follows:
```java
MyObject obj = new MyObject();
```
This is done in an entirely different way in objective-c and can take some getting used to. When an object is declared you must put a '*' symbol (pointer) to give the variable a pointer value. Generally to initialise an object you must allocate memory (dont worry) and call an initialisation method:
```objective-c
MyObject *obj; //declare object
obj = [[MyObject alloc] init]; //initialise object
MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init]; //declare and initialise object at once
```
The alloc and init methods are common across every subclass of NSObject (much like java's Object) so you are not required to write and manage memory yourself.
A common thing to do is to write some custom init methods which provide different initialisations. 

```objective-c

-(id)init{
    if(self = [super init]){
        //custom init code
    }
}

//custom init
-(id)initWithSomeVariableSetToSomething:(int)var{
    if(self = [super init]){
        self.theVariableToSet = var
    }
}
//call the above init method
MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] initWithSomeVariableSetToSomething:8];

//example from one of my apps - loading and setting variables when unarchived
- (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder {
    self = [self init];
    self.title = [coder decodeObjectForKey:@"title"];
    self.timeline = [coder decodeObjectForKey:@"timeline"];
    self.length = [coder decodeDoubleForKey:@"length"];
    self.colour = [coder decodeIntForKey:@"colour"];
    return self;
}
//the above init will get called when the following is called (more on archiving later)
MyObject *obj = [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithFile:filename];
```
If an object has a method with a + instead of - then you can call the method without needing to do the alloc and init
```objective-c
//return a String instance
+(id)initAString{
    return @"A string";
}
//return a SomeObject instance (in AClass.m)
+(id)initSomeObject{
    return [[SomeObject alloc] init];
}
//calling a class method to init an object
NSString *s = [AClass initAString];
SomeObject *o = [AClass initSomeObject];
```
One of the most common instance variables you will use will be NSString, the string type for Objective-c. NSString have a lot of class methods to choose from. And can be initialised in many ways.
```objective-c
NSString *s;
s = @"A string";
s = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Insert an int %i and a float %f and another string %@", 1, 1.0f, @"Another String"];
s = [NSString stringWithString:@"Another string"];
NSLog(@"%@",s); //print s
```

## Instantiating
If you call a method on null, you do not get a null pointer exception, instead the message is quietly ignored. This can be extremely frustrating. For example adding objects to an uninitialised array object will do absolutely nothing, meaning when you try to use them later nothing happens either.

## Misc
### Blocks
### Structs
Every now and again you'll run into a struct. This is exactly the same as it is c. They are used to represent things like the frame of anything that is rendered onto the screen, representing the x and y coordinates as well as the width and height.

##Hello, world program
1. Fire up Xcode, it is an OS X only application so will need to run on a mac or in virtual machine
2. Click create a new Xcode project, we'll start with the Command Line Tool option, under OS X as a template
3. Set a project name (HelloWorld) and fill in the company identifier (Practice), set the type drop down to Foundation
4. Save to a sensible place
5. Embarrassingly, the template already says hello world. Switch to main.m to find it
```objective-c
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
    {
    
        @autoreleasepool {
            
            // insert code here...
            NSLog(@"Hello, World!");
            
        }
        return 0;
    }
```
    The dot m extension is where you place all the executable code, while public header files use a dot h extension, more on that later!
6. Click the play arrow in the top left to build and run the solution, or press command + r
When the solution runs, the output pane will pop up from the bottom of the xcode window. It will say the date and some other stuff on the same line as "Hello, World!", then an exit code of 0 - which we know means success from c.

###Things to note:
- @autoreleasepool refers to automatic reference counting (ARC), this is the way that the foundation framework manages memory. Anything that is executed in its scope will take care of itself, with one exception.
- The @ infront of a string makes it an NSString, the foundation framework version of a string. [It's class reference can be found here](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html)
- NSLog is what printed out the date (also a line break) but you could use printf, as objective-c extends c. Printf does not work with NSStrings, so you would need to remove the at sign, and append a new line character. 
```objective-c
  printf("Hello, World\n");
```

##Expanding the program
Let's start writing some code of our own. The hello world example was stolen by Apple, so let's write a program that will create an array of different greetings, then traverse over it to print each one. 
1. I just deleted the old NSLog line so I had nothing between the @autoreleasepool flags
2. The collection we will use is called an [NSArray](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/NSArray.html) and there are at least 3 ways to initialise one. 
  1. The general way    
```objective-c
        NSArray *greetings = [[NSArray alloc] init];
```
  2. A convenience constructor, lots of objects have these    
```objective-c
        NSArray *greetings = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Hello", @"Bonjour", @"Guten tag"];
```
  3. The literal way    
```objective-c
        NSArray *greetings = @[@"Hello", @"Bonjour", @"Guten tag"];
```    
Here the square brackets represent the array literal (like quotation marks represent string literals) and not method calls.

##Recently added, don't know where to put
###Mutable vs Immutable
Most objective-c objects are mutable by default, but there are some which have differently named mutable/immutable classes. Immutable objects are essentially read-only once they are initialised, while Mutable objects are editable after they are initialised. 
    For example, suppose you initialise an array as in the above example:
```objective-c
NSArray *greetings = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Hello", @"Bonjour", @"Guten tag"];
```
Then wanted to add an object or modify the index, you would need to create an entirely new NSArray to make the changes. However, by using an NSMutableArray it is as simple as:
    
```objective-c
NSMutableArray *greetings = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"Hello", @"Bonjour", @"Guten tag"];
[greetings addObject:@"Konnichiwa"]; //append object to array
[greetings insertObject:@"Nihao" atIndex:2]; //insert object at index 2
```
    
If you wish to make an Immutable object from a Mutable object you can do this fairly easily
    
```objective-c
NSArray *immutableGreetings = greetings; //make an immutable version of greetings array
```
    
A list of the objects which have differently named mutable/immutable counterparts:
```objective-c
-NSMutableArray
-NSMutableDictionary
-NSMutableSet
-NSMutableIndexSet
-NSMutableCharacterSet
-NSMutableData
-NSMutableString
-NSMutableAttributedString
-NSMutableURLRequest
```
