Graduated from Otago university at the end of 2013. You may remember me as a tutor in 232, don't worry I'm a lot better at objective-c than c. As part of a team I've built one app that's been released, one that nearly was and one that will be out soon. This year we have plans for two or three more, with all this on the go I've been keen to learn more and more about objective-c and how to build great iOS apps.

I decided to write this guide as I felt the learning curve for objective-c was a little bigger than it should have been. There's lots of great guides to working with cocoa-touch etc, but as programmers we want to learn the language and then the thrills! Good luck to you all.
