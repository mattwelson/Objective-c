Graduated from Otago university at the end of 2013. You may remember me as a tutor in 232, don't worry I'm a lot better at objective-c than c. As part of a team I've built one app that's been released, one that nearly was and one that will be out soon. This year we have plans for two or three more contracts, with all this on the go I've been keen to learn more and more about objective-c and how to build great iOS apps.

I decided to write this guide as I felt the learning curve for objective-c was a little bigger than it should have been. There's lots of great guides to working with cocoa-touch etc, but as programmers we want to learn the language and then the frills! Good luck to you all.

Graduated and got my bsc+pgdipsci in 2013. Built 3 apps that were released on the store, 1 is down because it didn't get renewed, and 2 are just client apps for things like timesheets and inhouse stuff (easier than getting an ad hoc development profile as well as an app store profile). Biggest one is due to be released in march of this year (so I need to fix all the bugs which is lame). At the moment I am pretty much a contract app builder and have loads of dev jobs in the pipeline.

Decided to help out, because now I know objective c as well as the back of my hand. Trust me on this, it is a dead easy language. Once you get over the initial formatting stuff its just simple. If you need any help with understanding how to write view controllers or custom views or connect to databases or share to social media sites/email, I can help.

*You'll notice we both said contracts. Why? There's a lot more consistent money in contracts, but developing your own app can like winning the lotto, and should also be where you start! Make something you'd love to use and go from there.*
